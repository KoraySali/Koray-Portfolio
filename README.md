# [Project 1: Deep Learning Wildfire Detection System](https://github.com/KoraySali/Dissertation_Archive/blob/main/README.md)
* Created multiple CNN-Machine Learning ensembled models from scratch achivieng no less than 94% accuracy for wildfire and smoke detection.
* Ability to identify from macro and micro level imagery, such as: satellites, CCTV, mobile phone or camera imagery.
* Front-end webpage created for the utility of the deep learning model from wildfire surveillance teams when needed at any time.
* Connected external camera feeds, such as: webcams and CCTV video feeds to simulate and leverage existing low-level technology camera systems that wildfire teams already tend to use.
* Flask PyCharm, Jupyter Notebook and Google Colaboratory were the platforms used, especially Google Colaboratory for it's external GPU use.
* Preprocessed, engineered and scraped images to be interpreted correctly by the CNN-based models.
* Compared pre-existing architectures such as: ResNet152, DenseNet201, VGG16, Xception where my CNN-SVM model outperformed DenseNet201 and Xception, achieving 95.79% accuracy while DeseNet201 achieved 94.17% and Xception achieved 89.33% respectively.
