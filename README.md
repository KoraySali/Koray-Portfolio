# Koray Saliah Portfolio

Below is a description and image of some of the projects and work I have completed throughout my career.

# [Project 1: Deep Learning Wildfire Detection System](https://github.com/KoraySali/Dissertation_Archive/blob/main/README.md)
* Developed CNN-ML ensemble models achieving consistent 94%+ accuracy for wildfire and smoke detection.
* Proficient in analysing macro and micro imagery (satellites, CCTV, mobile cameras).
* Created user-friendly front-end for on-demand deep learning model usage by wildfire surveillance teams.
* Integrated external camera feeds (webcams, CCTV) to enhance wildfire teams' existing camera systems.
* Employed Flask, PyCharm, Jupyter, and Google Colab, leveraging external GPU support.
* Processed, engineered, and optimised images for accurate interpretation by CNN models.
* Compared ResNet152, DenseNet201, VGG16, Xception; my CNN-SVM outperformed DenseNet201 (94.17%) and Xception (89.33%) with 95.79% accuracy.
