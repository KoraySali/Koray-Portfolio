# Koray Saliah Portfolio

Below is a description and image of some of the projects and work I have completed throughout my career.

# [Project 1: Deep Learning Wildfire Detection System](https://github.com/KoraySali/Dissertation_Archive/blob/main/README.md)
* Developed CNN-ML ensemble models achieving consistent 94%+ accuracy for wildfire and smoke detection.
* Proficient in analysing macro and micro imagery (satellites, CCTV, mobile cameras).
* Created user-friendly front-end for on-demand deep learning model usage by wildfire surveillance teams.
* Integrated external camera feeds (webcams, CCTV) to enhance wildfire teams' existing camera systems.
* Employed Flask, PyCharm, Jupyter, and Google Colab, leveraging external GPU support.
* Processed, engineered, and optimised images for accurate interpretation by CNN models.
* Compared ResNet152, DenseNet201, VGG16, Xception; my CNN-SVM outperformed DenseNet201 (94.17%) and Xception (89.33%) with 95.79% accuracy.

# [Project 2: Taxi Fare Prediction Regression](https://github.com/KoraySali/Taxi-Fare-Prediction/blob/main/README.md)
* Developed a precise taxi fare prediction model achieving an RMSE of 1.5~ for 10,000+ Bournemouth and Dorset journeys.
* Conducted extensive model comparison, showcasing Gradient Boosting Regressor, Random Forest, XGBRegressor, MLPRegressor and 6 other models each with competitive RMSE scores.
* Utilised advanced data analysis techniques for feature extraction, enhancing model performance through data-driven insights.
* Employed error analysis to identify and address outliers, resulting in heightened model accuracy and dependability.
* Executed the project adhering to the CRISP-DM methodology framework, ensuring a systematic and structured approach.
* Deployed the Gradient Boosting Regressor as the optimal choice, balancing accuracy and efficiency.
* Leveraged correlations between engineered features and fare predictions to gain valuable data-driven insights, iteratively refining model performance.
